## Introduction

NokNok is a play-to-earn game where players use various hammer skins to whack moles and collect Hammer coins ($HAMMER), the game's native cryptocurrency. With seasonal content, NFT integration, and DeFi elements, NokNok aims to create a vibrant and engaged community.

## Features

- **Seasonal Skins:** New meme-inspired hammer skins every two weeks.
- **NFT Integration:** Mint unique hammer skins as NFTs and trade them on secondary markets.
- **Play-to-Earn:** Earn $HAMMER tokens through gameplay and staking.
- **Boost Mechanism:** Upgrade your boost level to enhance gameplay efficiency.
- **Airdrops:** Receive exclusive NFTs and tokens through periodic airdrops.

## Gameplay

### Starting Equipment

- New users receive a default wooden hammer.

### Seasonal Skins

- Limited edition skins are introduced each season, reflecting current trends.
- The probability of obtaining these limited skins is fixed.

### Hammer Mechanics

- **Centralized Hammers:** Initially, hammers are centralized. Before or during the token launch, players can mint their hammers into NFTs or receive them via airdrop.
- **Hammer Draws:**
  - Players can draw hammers up to three times (adjustable parameter).
  - Every 24 hours, players receive three new draw opportunities (adjustable parameter).
  - Players can earn additional draw opportunities by completing daily tasks (one extra draw per day).

### Stamina

- **Daily Stamina Cap:** Players have a stamina cap of 80 per day (adjustable parameter).
  - Stamina limits the number of times players can whack moles to earn coins. Each whack consumes stamina, even if it misses the mole.
  - When stamina is depleted, only the number of successful whacks is recorded for leaderboard purposes, but no coins are awarded.
- **Stamina Recovery:** Stamina resets to the cap every 24 hours.

### Coin Rewards

- Players earn 1 to 5 Hammer coins for each successful whack.
- Inviting friends to join the game grants additional Hammer coins.

## Tokenomics

- **Native Token:** $HAMMER is issued on the blockchain.
- **Boost Mechanism:** Players can spend coins to upgrade their boost level, starting at level 1. Boosts allow for multitap functionality, enhancing gameplay efficiency.
- **Staking:** Players can stake their earned $HAMMER tokens for additional rewards.

The game operates on a seasonal model, with each season lasting two weeks. During each season, new meme-inspired hammer skins are introduced, reflecting current trending topics to attract and engage users.

In addition to the engaging gameplay of whacking moles and collecting coins, NokNok incorporates blockchain technology to enhance the user experience. Players can earn and trade unique NFT hammer skins, which are limited edition and can be collected or sold on various NFT marketplaces. The game also features a play-to-earn mechanism, where users can earn cryptocurrency rewards based on their in-game performance and achievements.

To further incentivize participation, NokNok offers periodic airdrops of exclusive NFTs and tokens to active players, creating a sense of anticipation and excitement. The integration of decentralized finance (DeFi) elements allows users to stake their earned tokens for additional rewards, fostering a vibrant and engaged community.

By combining the nostalgic fun of a classic whack-a-mole game with the innovative elements of Web3, NokNok aims to create a unique and rewarding gaming experience that appeals to both traditional gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike.
